# Mockoon

[Mockoon](https://mockoon.com/) is a really cool tools allowing you to build and run quick mock REST APIs.:wolf:

Nothing required like deployment, account or anything else.

:pencil: Better to use in a case where you need to quickly setup a mock, otherwise [Stubby](./stubby.md) might be a better alternative.

## How does it work ? :confused:

:one: Launch the app :runner:

:two: Configure few endpoints with help of the [doc](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/templating/fakerjs-helpers/) :clipboard:

:three: And it's ready to go :rocket:

## Advices :brain:

Combine it with [faker](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/templating/fakerjs-helpers/) in order to generate data easily and dynamically through you mocks :couple:
