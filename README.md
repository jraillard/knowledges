# Julien's "Cheat-Sheets"

Hi, there! :wave:

I’m Julien, a young and enthusiast 26-year-old fullstack-developer from france.

Recently i also made myself a [Tech'Vox Speaker](https://techvox.lepodcast.fr/) (feel free to take a look, or an ear ... :eyes:).

This repository is my personal knowledge-base. Here you'll find code-snippets, technical documentation, and command reference for various tools, and technologies that i tested or only heard about.

:warning: Be aware, every products can change over time (as stacks does :smiley:). I'll do my best to keep up with the latest changes and releases, but please understand that this won’t always be the case.

I created them as free resources in order to not spend time to recover knowledge about a stack i already seen.
